Update
------

Since originally creating this as a fun little weekend project, I've created a *much* better version at work, which I hope to be able to open source.
I'm leaving this project here in case anyone is currently using it, but honestly there are much better implementations out there. Thanks!

About
-----

SlideViewController is an effort to reproduce the "Slide away menu" effect that the new Facebook iOS App and many other apps are now doing.
